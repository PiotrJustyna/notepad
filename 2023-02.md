Here we go again with devcontainers + silverblue. I have some time in the evening, so trying out the latest comments in the thread I started a while ago: https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/vscode-devcontainers/45874/7

* I installed fresh silverblue on my old macbook air
* I configured wifi: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/OSTree (thank goodness I had an ethernet-usb adapter...)
* flatpak: https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora
* visual studio code via flatpak + flathub

Ha, the advice worked perfectly! Here is the quoted answer just in case the link gets lost:

```
I’m currently able to run VSCode with devcontainers on Fedora Silverblue. I use Flatpak VSCode, but installing it as a layered RPM is much easier. The following additional steps are needed for devcontainers to work with Podman:

    In your devcontainer.json file, you must set properties remoteUser and containerUser properly. For example, if you use any base image from Microsoft itself, you must set both properties to vscode.

    You must provide a file ~/.config/containers/containers.conf with the following contents:

[containers]
env = [
  "BUILDAH_FORMAT=docker"
]
label = false
userns = "keep-id"

If you’re using Flatpak VSCode, the following additional steps are needed:

    Create a wrapper script ~/.local/bin/podman-host with the following contents, and make it executable:

#!/bin/sh
exec flatpak-spawn --host podman "${@}"

    Configure Docker Path in your Dev Container extension settings to /var/home/[username]/.local/bin/podman-host

    Give your Flatpak write permission to /tmp folder:

flatpak override --filesystem=/tmp com.visualstudio.code
```
