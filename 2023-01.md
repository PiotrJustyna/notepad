* that vs code instruction also doesn't work on silverblue
* I'm now trying podman following this article: https://blog.while-true-do.io/podman-configure-vscode-for-containers/
  * since I'm using silverblue 37, podman is already installed
  * uninstall the flatpak version of vs code
  * add vs code repo:
    
    ```
    $ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo'
    ```
  * install vs code through `rpm-ostree`:
    ```
    rpm-ostree install podman code
    ```

* what I found yesterday doesn't work (the link is 2 years old after all), but vs code recommends going through [this documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), which I intend to do tomorrow.

* docker insalled on the host machine, flatpak application needs access to host's directory to use docker: https://www.reddit.com/r/flatpak/comments/j3hcad/flatpak_vscode_cannot_connect_to_docker/

* [fedora silverblue](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/getting-started/)
* flatpak - add flathub, a central repository of flatpak applications as the new flatpak remote: https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora
* vs code can then be installed through the flathub remote
* dev containers extension installs without problems
* docker needs to be installed on the host os: https://blog.2to.fun/en/posts/install-docker-in-silverblue/ ***or*** the extension should be configured to use podman instead of docker: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6666
