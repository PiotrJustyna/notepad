* [fedora silverblue](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/getting-started/)
* flatpak - add flathub, a central repository of flatpak applications as the new flatpak remote: https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora
* vs code can then be installed through the flathub remote
* dev containers extension installs without problems
* docker needs to be installed on the host os: https://blog.2to.fun/en/posts/install-docker-in-silverblue/ ***or*** the extension should be configured to use podman instead of docker: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6666
